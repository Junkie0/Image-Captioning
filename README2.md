## ✨ Key Features

- **Image Upload** – User-friendly web interface for uploading images.
- **AI-Powered Captions** – Generates captions using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.
- **Responsive UI** – Simple, clean, and mobile-friendly interface.
- **Easy Deployment** – Minimal setup required for local or cloud deployment.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   conda create -n caption-env python=3.10
   conda activate caption-env
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   _(If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually using:)_

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow flask numpy pillow matplotlib
   ```

4. **Ensure the upload directory exists**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p static/uploads
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
